# **Project Description**

A project for me to learn nextjs, typescript, and learn to use facial recognition in python.

This project is able to show tasks given to a certain person using facial recognition. The user would simply show their face, and the tasks would be displayed. For others, there is a feature to give tasks to certain people and add a new person to the system.

The code could easily be modified to be used for clocking in and out as well.

This project is still in development, and will never be perfect as I am using this as a learning opportunity.
